# techblog

A new Flutter application.
TECH BLOG APP
This is a technical blog app.
The app  consists of three screens:
● Menu Page
● Tech News Page
● Scholarships Page

Menu Page

The menu page is built using Text Widgets, Sized Box,
Images Widgets, ClipRRect which are placed vertically
in a Column.
(We used images with pre-existing text and in this app,
we have not used any code(stacks) to add text over the
image)
On this page, we are also using Navigation. On clicking
on the first image, we get directed to the tech news
page. Similarly, on clicking the second image, we get
directed to the scholarships page.

Tech News Page

The tech news page is built using Column, Text, Divider
widgets.
It consists of various links to articles containing the latest developments in tech.
When we click on the name of an article, we should be redirected to the website which 
contains the whole article as shown in the second image.
We  use the URL Launcher package to do the same.To overcome overflow issue, Listview builder , listview seperated 
, cards , listtile widgets are used  to make the page
scrollable.

It consists of various links to articles containing scholarships in tech.
